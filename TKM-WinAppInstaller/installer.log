Chocolatey detected you are not running from an elevated command shell
 (cmd/powershell).

 You may experience errors - many functions/packages
 require admin rights. Only advanced users should run choco w/out an
 elevated shell. When you open the command shell, you should ensure
 that you do so with "Run as Administrator" selected. If you are
 attempting to use Chocolatey in a non-administrator setting, you
 must select a different location other than the default install
 location. See
 https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup#non-administrative-install
 for details.

For the question below, you have 20 seconds to make a selection.

 Do you want to continue?([Y]es/[N]o): 
Timeout or your choice of '' is not a valid selection.
Uninstalling the following packages:
Google.Chrome
Google.Chrome is not installed. Cannot uninstall a non-existent package.

Chocolatey uninstalled 0/1 packages. 1 packages failed.
 See the log for details (C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\logs\chocolatey.log).

Failures
 - Google.Chrome - Google.Chrome is not installed. Cannot uninstall a non-existent package.

If a package uninstall is failing and/or you've already uninstalled the
 software outside of Chocolatey, you can attempt to run the command
 with `-n` to skip running a chocolateyUninstall script, additionally
 adding `--skip-autouninstaller` to skip an attempt to automatically
 remove system-installed software. Only the packaging files are removed
 and not things like software installed to Programs and Features.

If a package is failing because it is a dependency of another package
 or packages, then you may first need to consider if it needs to be
 removed as packages have dependencies for a reason. If
 you decide that you still want to remove it, head into
 `$env:ChocolateyInstall\lib` and find the package folder you want to
 be removed. Then delete the folder for the package. You should use
 this option only as a last resort.
